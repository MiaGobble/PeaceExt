# PeaceExt
PeaceExt is a program that allows you to **automatically open your code from Roblox Studio in an external IDE of your choice**, such as Visual Studio Code or Notepad++. This is a heavy edit of [rbx-extedit](https://github.com/MemoryPenguin/rbx-exteditor), programmed in Go.

As long as the *.exe* file for PeaceExt is running, you can easily open your code in your IDE by simply double-clicking your script (the same way you normally open it!). Once open, you can sync it back to Studio by saving it with `Ctrl-S`.

> ### ⚠️ Notice
> This is not a final product and is currently in the testing phase as an early concept and tech demo. This stage of development intends to find issues and polish the roadmap.

# How to use it
For simplicity, I put together a very quick and very simple video demonstrating the setup process for PeaceExt.

# What's to come
This is an ***early access tech concept*** for the actual thing PeaceExt wants to be: a Rojo alternative. In the future, it will automatically generate project folders with `default_project.json` files that are cross-compatible with Rojo and Wally. These features aren't here yet but expect them sometime in the future.

I will also be gathering feedback during this stage of development to make sure I stay on the correct course of development. All constructive ideas are taken into account! Please report issues as well.
